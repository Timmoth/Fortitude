## What is Fortitude?
**Fortitude** is a .NET testing utility that spins up a lightweight in-process server so your tests can define **fake service behavior dynamically and fluently**.

It allows you to:
- Mock real services without work arounds
- Perform true **black-box testing**  
- Define test-specific server behavior inline  
- Build robust integration tests without standing up full external infrastructure  

Fortitude acts as a highly flexible, temporary **“illusion server”** for your tests — returning exactly what you define, when you define it.

## **Operation Fortitude in history**

The name **Fortitude** is a deliberate nod to **Operation Fortitude**, the famed WW2 deception campaign used by the Allies in 1944.

Operation Fortitude was part of the larger deception strategy preceding D-Day.  
Its purpose was to convince German intelligence that the invasion would occur in **Pas-de-Calais** instead of Normandy.

The Allies used:
- Inflatable tanks  
- Wooden aircraft  
- Fake radio traffic  
- Entire ghost armies  

All designed to **simulate real military forces that didn’t actually exist**.
 
Much like its namesake, **Fortitude helps you cheat reality just enough to achieve your objective**.

## Key Features
- **Ideal for black-box testing**  
- **Fluent API** for defining fake routes, responses, and behaviors  
- **Middleware-driven architecture** that intercepts routes  
- **No need for external mocks**  
- **Minimal Configuration**
